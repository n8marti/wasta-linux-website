Rufus has the advantage of not needing to be \u0026ldquo;installed\u0026rdquo;: a user can run it directly from the downloaded \u0026ldquo;.exe file\u0026rdquo;.\nTo use Rufus, first insert a 4GB (or greater) USB drive (WARNING! using the Rufus default settings, this USB drive WILL BE COMPLETELY REFORMATTED, so all data WILL BE LOST!).\nThen, start Rufus. It should auto-detect the USB device and look similar to this:\nKeep all the default settings, and click the CD icon (seen in the above screen shot) and navigate to the Wasta-Linux ISO you downloaded. After you select the Wasta-Linux ISO, Rufus should look like this:\nClick \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo;, and, after completing, your bootable Wasta-Linux USB stick should be ready!\nAfter booting the machine you want to install Wasta-Linux on from the created USB device, if the installer has been set up correctly you should see the following boot menu:\nPlease use the first boot option \u0026ldquo;live - boot the Live System\u0026rdquo; even if you are ready to install. Once the Live System is booted, you can click the icon on the desktop to begin the Wasta-Linux installation.\nUsing Linux For Linux users, in order to make a UEFI and \u0026ldquo;Legacy\u0026rdquo; compatible \u0026ldquo;read only\u0026rdquo; USB installer drive use the \u0026ldquo;Startup Disk Creator\u0026rdquo; from Ubuntu or Wasta-Linux.

Follow this guide to maintain \u0026lsquo;wasta-custom-xyz\u0026rsquo; custom packages.\n (Optional) Create a Custom Wasta-Linux ISO: As with method 1 above, you can install Wasta-Linux on a clean test system, then install your wasta-custom-xyz package, and then follow the process to create a custom Wasta-Linux ISO.\n   "},{"idx":5,"href":"/hugo/home/download/","title":"Downloads","content":" Wasta-Linux: Downloads If you are unsure of which download may be best for your hardware, please use the links at the bottom of this page to post to the Wasta-Linux Users list to ask for clarification.\n18.04  Wasta-Linux-18.04.3-64Bit  updated: 2019-08-30 md5: f13a4cf5d18e8f40a5cfd0722dc1d814  Notes:\n Based on Ubuntu 18.04 \u0026ldquo;Bionic\u0026rdquo; Interface: Cinnamon is the default interface, with Gnome-Shell also installed Long-Term Support: Security updates provided by Ubuntu through April 2023 UEFI Compatible: Fully Compatible with newer UEFI and Secure Boot features used by Windows 8+ computers Linux Kernel: 5.0 (due to Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Hardware Enablement Stack\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; the original 18.04 release included Linux Kernel 4.15) Paratext: Paratext 8.0 / 9 Beta supported (Paratext 7.5 not available) AMD Users: Use the below 18.04.1 ISO for Lenovo 14W and possibly other computers with a recent AMD Graphics processors   Wasta-Linux 18.04.1 Hardware Compatibility Download ↕  Wasta-Linux 18.04.1 may be needed if you experience any hardware compatibility issues with the 5.0 Linux Kernel included in Wasta-Linux 18.04.3.\nWasta-Linux-18.04.1-64Bit  updated: 2018-09-27 md5: ce7f69957d92f11130732f37771dbac8      16.04  Wasta-Linux-16.04.4-64Bit  updated: 2018-04-04 md5: 5de5238868ceab725e2bbc914b1d471e  Wasta-Linux-16.04.4-32Bit  updated: 2018-04-04 md5: 378bab914f86f208af021146a68c38ea  Notes:\n Based on Ubuntu 16.04 \u0026ldquo;Xenial\u0026rdquo; Interface: Cinnamon is the default interface, with Ubuntu Unity also installed Long-Term Support: Security updates provided by Ubuntu through April 2021 UEFI Compatible: Fully Compatible with newer UEFI and Secure Boot features used by Windows 8+ computers Linux Kernel: 4.13 Paratext: Paratext 7.5 and Paratext 8.0 supported     Wasta-Linux Installation Tips and Tricks:  The above images can be put on a USB flash drive or DVD just like a standard Ubuntu or Linux Mint ISO.\n Follow these instructions if you aren\u0026rsquo;t starting with a Wasta-Linux ISO but rather want to upgrade your existing Ubuntu installation to Wasta-Linux.\n If you are wanting to do an \u0026ldquo;in-place upgrade\u0026rdquo; from a previous version of Wasta-Linux and don\u0026rsquo;t have a separate home partition, you can follow this guide.\n If you are wanting to run Wasta-Linux in VirtualBox, first read these instructions.\n To install Wasta-Linux to a portable, encrypted USB drive without touching the main OS on the computer, you can follow this guide.\n  "},{"idx":6,"href":"/hugo/home/faq/","title":"FAQ","content":" Wasta-Linux: Frequently Asked Questions Below are answers to some of the more common questions you may have about Wasta-Linux. First, a question and response that lays the foundation for Wasta-Linux:\nWhy Linux? One colleague answered the question \u0026ldquo;Why Linux\u0026rdquo; concisely using 3 main points. In brief, Linux is:\n Partner friendly: share with everyone, not only privledged organizations that have corporate license keys Budget friendly: not only does it not have a cost, it will also save support time Customizing friendly: adapt Linux to your use case, rather than having to adapt your usage to the limitations of a locked-down operating system that may not have you in mind as their target user base  Basically it is about freedom (not just \u0026ldquo;free as in no cost\u0026rdquo;), which means freedom to customize for our situation and for our specific users (see more below on this topic), freedom for all to use it, and \u0026ldquo;free from viruses.\u0026rdquo; * For more on these freedoms, please read the \u0026ldquo;case study\u0026rdquo; on our organization\u0026rsquo;s move from Windows to Linux in NE Africa.\n* Yes, eventually there may be Linux viruses, but its design is inherently more secure than Windows which was originally designed for single-user \u0026ldquo;non-networked\u0026rdquo; computers. Over the years Windows has applied security fixes in an \u0026ldquo;ad-hoc fashion\u0026rdquo; to try to account for today\u0026rsquo;s always online environment, but many inherent vulnerabilities remain. Click on a question below to see the response:\n Which Linux desktop and distribution is Wasta-Linux based on? ↕  With Ubuntu being recognized as the market leader in the Linux ecosystem, it was determined that using Ubuntu as a base for Wasta-Linux is the best choice. Using Ubuntu as a base ensures the broadest compatibility with Linux applications for Wasta-Linux.\nHowever, the default interface, called a \u0026lsquo;desktop environment\u0026rsquo; in Linux, used by Ubuntu proved challenging to use as it was not familiar enough for users coming from a Windows environment. After a lot of testing with several different Linux desktops, Cinnamon, created by the Linux Mint team, was chosen as the default interface for Wasta-Linux. For those that aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in adhering to a Windows-style interface, Cinnamon is flexible enough to be able to be reconfigured to match layouts inspired by macOS or Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s Unity.\n    What customizations are included in Wasta-Linux? ↕  For the curious, here is a summary of some of the most significant modifications made to Wasta-Linux when compared to stock Ubuntu plus the Cinnamon desktop interface:\n \u0026ldquo;SIL ready\u0026rdquo;: The SIL Linux repository is included and standard SIL fonts have been added, so that applications such as Paratext, Bloom, Fieldworks, Adapt It, WeSay and kmfl (Keyman) are ready for installation from the Software Center.\n Several applications added, several others removed. Notable additions include:\n Wasta-Backup: simple \u0026ldquo;version backup\u0026rdquo; utility Wasta-Offline: offline software updates and installs Wasta-Layout: desktop layout settings utility Wasta-Menus: limits the visible applications in the Main Menu Wasta-Resources: centralized distribution of reference and documentation materials Bloom: Literacy materials development for language communities Skype Kdenlive: Non-linear video editing software GoldenDict: Offline (and online using Wikipedia or other sources) Dictionary / Thesaurus Modem Manager GUI: USB 3G modem tool for balance check and top-up commands Pinta: simple to use \u0026ldquo;MS Paint\u0026rdquo; alternative Kiwix: offline simple English version of Wikipedia (due to it\u0026rsquo;s size - 1.6 GB - it is not installed by default in Wasta-Linux) Klavaro: typing tutor some useful command-line utilities such as:  wavemon: a wifi network diagnostic tool traceroute iperf: a network throughput test tool   Centralized update and distribution of \u0026ldquo;future Wasta customizations\u0026rdquo;: No more being \u0026ldquo;stranded\u0026rdquo; as seems to happen with Ubuntu LTS releases.\n      What is the Wasta-Linux background story? ↕  Wasta-Linux development began in 2011-2012 in NE Africa (أهلا وسهلا) where it became apparent that the efforts of a couple IT workers would be better spent testing, evaluating, and customizing Linux to meet the local team\u0026rsquo;s computing needs rather than re-installing and configuring Windows every few months after the latest viruses swept through again. It continues to be used as the primary operating system of our partner organization in that location.\nSince 2014 the main development of Wasta-Linux has continued from Ethiopia (እንኳን ደህና መጣ) and it has become the primary operating system supported by our organization in Ethiopia, with nearly 200 installations and counting.\nRead more about the original motivations for Wasta-Linux in the \u0026ldquo;case study\u0026rdquo; on our organization\u0026rsquo;s move from Windows to Linux.\n    So, what is \u0026#39;wasta\u0026#39; anyway? ↕  \u0026ldquo;Wasta\u0026rdquo; literally means \u0026ldquo;intermediary\u0026rdquo;, but it implies more: it is seen as having \u0026ldquo;insider connections\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;special favor or ability to \u0026lsquo;side-step the normal process.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Think of needing to wait several days in the heat of a government office to get an official \u0026ldquo;stamp\u0026rdquo; on a piece of paper. If you have wasta, then you are able to come around through the \u0026ldquo;side door\u0026rdquo; and get the stamp immediately. So, Wasta-Linux is essentially \u0026ldquo;cutting to the front of the line\u0026rdquo; for new users to Linux in order to get a usable system without all the effort of starting from nothing. The analogy doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when taken too literally, however: don\u0026rsquo;t think there is anything unethical or illegal in the process! Wasta-Linux is just a light-hearted way to explain that you get the Linux you have been hoping exists without needing to hack on it to get it set up as you want!     How many Wasta-Linux users are there? ↕  Great question! There are several locations using Wasta-Linux around the world, with some locations working in an offline-only environment. This means a single download could represent 10s of users or more. As of 2019, it seems clear that there are at least 500 Wasta-Linux users, but it could be multiples of that number.     How can Wasta-Linux be customized to meet my needs? ↕  Beyond individual users that may find the Wasta-Linux system available here \u0026ldquo;as-is\u0026rdquo; to fit them well in their situations, it is intended that Wasta-Linux can be used as a base for \u0026ldquo;location specific customized versions\u0026rdquo; of Wasta-Linux (providing pre-installed location-specific fonts, keyboards, default applications, settings, reference documents and training materials, etc.). Once these \u0026ldquo;location specific customized Wasta-Linux versions\u0026rdquo; are made available, the ease of install of this customized Linux distribution will provide an opportunity for it to self-propagate throughout the region, even among low-tech computer users.\nIf customizing is of interest to you, please see this page: Wasta-Linux: Customizing for your needs\n   "},{"idx":7,"href":"/hugo/home/customizing/github-setup/","title":"GitHub Setup","content":" Wasta-Linux: GitHub Setup This page is part of the Wasta-Linux customizing process.\nFollow the below steps in order establish your GitHub ID and register a SSH key with GitHub in order to be ready to contribute to the Wasta-Linux custom packages hosted on GitHub.\n Sign up for a GitHub ID https://github.com/\n Create an Open SSH Key  \u0026ldquo;Passwords and Keys\u0026rdquo; app: Select File \u0026gt; New from the menu to create a Secure Shell Key (if you do not already have one: if you already have one you can skip ahead to step 3)\n Give the key a descriptive name, ignore any Advance key options, and click \u0026ldquo;Just Create Key\u0026rdquo;\n DO NOT set a passphrase when prompted, just leave it blank and click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; 2 times.\n You should now see your SSH key in the \u0026ldquo;OpenSSH keys\u0026rdquo; section of the Passwords and Keys application:\n  Add SSH Key to your GitHub account  \u0026ldquo;Passwords and Keys\u0026rdquo; app: Open the SSH key created in step 2 and go to the \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; tab, noting the location of the folder. Typically this would be the hidden .ssh folder in your user home.\n Open the id\\_rsa.pub file (the \u0026ldquo;Public Key\u0026rdquo; for your SSH key) in the ssh folder and copy the entire contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard. The file should look something like this:\n Log into your GitHub account and click on your user name / icon in the top right of any GitHub page, and choose \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo;. From the main \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; page you should see a \u0026ldquo;SSH keys\u0026rdquo; tab like this:\n In the \u0026ldquo;SSH keys\u0026rdquo; tab, click \u0026ldquo;Add SSH key\u0026rdquo;, entering a description in the \u0026ldquo;Title\u0026rdquo; field and pasting in the contents of your id_rsa.pub file from the clipboard in the \u0026ldquo;Key\u0026rdquo; field. Click \u0026ldquo;Add key\u0026rdquo;.\n Your \u0026ldquo;SSH keys\u0026rdquo; tab should now list the key:\n  Contact the Wasta-Linux team Please contact us through the Wasta-Linux Users Forum after you have created your GitHub account so we can add your GitHub ID as a GitHub Wasta-Linux organization member.\n  "},{"idx":8,"href":"/hugo/home/","title":"Homes","content":""},{"idx":9,"href":"/hugo/tutorials/inplace-upgrade/","title":"Inplace Upgrade","content":" Inplace Upgrades: Migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux This guide is for migrating between major versions of Wasta-Linux (eg. from 16.04 to 18.04) when the machine does not have a separate home partition. Even without a separate home partition, this type of upgrade will not remove a user\u0026rsquo;s home directory and all files and settings from this \u0026lsquo;home\u0026rsquo; will be migrated to the new system.\n Backup Make sure important personal files are backed up in case something goes awry.\n Get UIDs Get a listing of the users and UIDs (user IDs) from the existing system. We need it to match with the new installation or security problems will exist after you re-install and you many not be able to login to your new system. Get the list this way:\n Terminal * command:\nsudo grep \u0026quot;/home\u0026quot; /etc/passwd   You will get output something like this:\nsyslog:x:104:109::/home/syslog:/bin/false rik:x:1000:1000:rik,,,:/home/rik:/bin/bash etbadmin:x:1001:1001:etbadmin,,,:/home/etbadmin:/bin/bash test:x:1002:1002:test,,,:/home/test:/bin/bash  So for me that means that user \u0026ldquo;rik\u0026rdquo; is UID 1000, user \u0026ldquo;etbadmin\u0026rdquo; is UID 1001, and user \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; is UID 1002. This is very important!! When you install, the UID created by the installer is ALWAYS 1000. So I would install using \u0026ldquo;rik\u0026rdquo; so it gets assigned UID 1000. After the install, I would first create user \u0026ldquo;etbadmin\u0026rdquo; so that it will get assigned UID 1001, and then create user \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; so that it will get assigned UID 1002. If you get this mixed up we can fix it later, but it is easier to do it in the right order so that everything matches.\n Install: Choose \u0026ldquo;Something else\u0026rdquo; Create a USB installer as normal. Proceed as normal using the USB installer, making sure to choose \u0026ldquo;SOMETHING ELSE\u0026rdquo; at the \u0026ldquo;Installation type\u0026rdquo; screen.

It will warn you that it will NOT replace data in \u0026ldquo;non system folders\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;. basically this is telling us your home won\u0026rsquo;t be wiped out so this is very important.\n Continue WITHOUT Formatting Partition Click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; and you will get back to the \u0026ldquo;Something Else\u0026rdquo; list where you will see your partition is now listed as \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;. Again make sure to NOT CHECK THE BOX next to format. Finally you can click Install Now.\nYou will get the following messages just informing you that it will ONLY delete data from the \u0026lsquo;system folders\u0026rsquo; (meaning your HOME will not be deleted). The second message just indicates that the \u0026ldquo;swap\u0026rdquo; (for \u0026ldquo;virtual RAM\u0026rdquo;) partition will be formatted. Click \u0026ldquo;Continue\u0026rdquo; to both messages.\n Proceed with install as normal Restart and login to the new system after the installation completes.\nNote: You will likely receive a message saying there was an error restoring previously installed applications. This should not prevent your upgraded system from being able to run, so you can just click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; to proceed as normal. After starting your new system, you may need to install any applications that you previously had installed that are not default applications in the newer Wasta-Linux version.\n Run Wasta-Reset Running Wasta-Reset makes sure all the default user settings are applied so the user will have the standard interface experience from the new system.\n Create Additional Users Proceed creating additional users in the correct order (refer to step 2 above to make sure of the correct order: the user created from the installer is assigned UID 1001, the first additional user created will be assigned UID 1001, etc.)\nAgain Wasta-Reset should be run after logging in for the first time to ensure that the user will have the standard user interface experience.\n  "},{"idx":10,"href":"/hugo/tutorials/kiwix/","title":"Kiwix - Wikipedia Offline","content":" Kiwix: Wikipedia Offline Kiwix is a software utility created to use Wikipedia and other large web-based content resources when internet is not available.\nHere is an introduction to Kiwix from their website:\n The world has a connectivity issue In many places internet can be slow, unreliable or even censored.

Who can use it? Nearly anyone can use Wasta-Linux instead of Windows on a computer. If you are used to using a Windows computer you will notice that some things look different (click here to see major differences), but most things behave in similar ways. Wasta-Linux is especially designed for language work: developing and producing materials in minority languages. Materials you want to produce may include:\n books, magazines, newsletters in your language videos, talking books, audio versions of books literacy teaching materials a dictionary translations of the Bible or other written and audio works  The biggest difference is that Wasta-Linux has LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, which only works in Windows. It is not hard to learn how to use the LibreOffice programs if you are used to Microsoft Office. In LibreOffice:\n Writer takes the place of Word Calc takes the place of Excel Impress takes the place of Powerpoint Draw takes the place of Publisher (partly, but Bloom is better for many publishing needs)  In addition, Wasta-Linux includes these programs for language workers:\n Bloom \u0026ndash; Easily create or translate books. Also create materials for teaching children and adults to read WeSay and Fieldworks Language Explorer \u0026ndash; Collect and sort words; produce written or online dictionaries KeyMan For Linux \u0026ndash; Set the computer to type in any language (\u0026ldquo;special characters\u0026rdquo; or scripts)  Other programs you can use in Wasta-Linux are:\n Paratext \u0026ndash; Translate the Bible into your language Adapt It \u0026ndash; Automated help to \u0026ldquo;adapt\u0026rdquo; Bible or other text from a related language GoldenDict \u0026ndash; Offline English dictionary (also online link to Wikipedia) GIMP and Inkscape \u0026ndash; Edit photos and create graphics OpenShot \u0026ndash; Edit video files Audacity \u0026ndash; Record and edit audio files VLC \u0026ndash; Play DVDs, videos, music from your computer Thunderbird \u0026ndash; Send and receive email Wasta-Backup \u0026ndash; Back up your important files easily and often Modem Manager \u0026ndash; Connect to the Internet using a cellular/mobile modem App Builders \u0026ndash; Create an app for phones and tablets with text \u0026amp; audio in your language  And much more\u0026hellip;\nOne of the biggest advantages to using Wasta-Linux is that it can not \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo; Windows viruses. So you will not lose your work (and waste time) when a virus attacks your computer!\nWhat do you need to know to use Wasta-Linux? If you have not used a computer before it is easy to start using programs for language work. You need a laptop or desktop computer and a power source for the computer.\nWasta-Backup: Protecting your Language Data Simple Automatic Backups The language data for your software in use, for example the Paratext files for Scripture, all live in Wasta-Linux in a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; or standard place on your hard disk in the computer. If we leave everything alone, then you do not really need to know where these files actually live\u0026hellip; your advisor needs to know this\u0026hellip; but you can pretty much forget about this concern.\nHowever, due to fire or theft, or computer break-down possibilities, it is still nice to get the language data copied onto some other media for safe keeping. The preferred way to do this is by a simple insertion of a USB memory stick into the USB hole in the side of your computer. The Wasta-Backup program will then take care of the rest. Your advisor should have already shown you how to do this, but these pictures might help you to remember.\nOnce the memory stick is inserted into the notebook, then this dialog box will pop up on your screen. All you really have to do here is click the button \u0026ldquo;Backup\u0026rdquo; in the centre of this graphical box. Such boxes are called \u0026ldquo;dialog boxes\u0026rdquo; since the computer and its software are trying to talk to you, and give you instructions in a \u0026ldquo;dialog\u0026rdquo; of some sort.\nAfter a minute or so, the Backup dialog box should look like this. Note the \u0026ldquo;Backup Complete\u0026rdquo; message at the bottom of the box.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! You have copied all your important data files, whether they be Paratext files, or Bloom literacy materials, or documents that you wrote to Parliament in Libre Office Word, or important email files (if you use the Thunderbird email program), or any spread sheets, or presentations\u0026hellip;. it all got backed up onto the portable memory stick. You might want to have two memory sticks in case one gets lost or destroyed. You might have a third one that you send to your advisor from time to time in the mail, or by airplane.\nTo close the Wasta-Backup dialog, click the upper right hand corner \u0026ldquo;x\u0026rdquo; in the box, in the same manner as any other program you will encounter under Wasta-Linux.\nNote that Paratext users have other methods of backing up their data, including on-line repositories if they have a Digicel or wireless modem to the telecom network. But mobile towers can go down for weeks, and smart-phones uses a modems can be stolen. It\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea with language data to have other methods of backing up. Please backup regularly to a mem stick, at least once a day. Also, this is really the only way to preserve or backup a letter that you may have written with Libre Office Writer.\nRestore Lost Data Files Normally there is no reason to restore lost data, but strange things do happen to computers from time to time.\nRestoration of language data is a rather advanced topic for the Language Worker and is normally a task reserved for your \u0026ldquo;Language Consultant\u0026rdquo; or advisor that is helping you with your language programme. It is mentioned here for completeness, but if you have recognized that somehow, presently, the language data files are in error or corrupted, then it would be a good idea for you to be personally trained. To find and restore the data back from the days when the data was correct can be complicated and basically one needs to search back in time to the place before the error or corruption occurred.\nWasta-Backup does \u0026ldquo;remember\u0026rdquo; your data and keeps a running history as you progress in your work. So, if a bad day occurred way back three weeks ago, and IF you have been doing daily backups onto a memory stick (as you have been told to do), then it can be very easy to go back in time and restore the lost data to its former glory.\nWasta-Offline: Update Software Easily by Memory Stick Offline Updates of Software You Use\nOne of the most powerful new features of Wasta-Linux is the ability to do a simple upgrade of ALL you software applications, plus Wasta-Linux itself, and without disturbing your language data, and WITHOUT the necessity of a good Internet connect. In fact, we can do this without the Internet entirely. The system for this is called Wasta-Offline and the software to help you is already present to run in your version of Wasta-Linux. What you will need however is for your Advisor to send you an \u0026ldquo;update\u0026rdquo; USB memory stick or maybe a flash SD card with all the software updates present and ready to go. This mem stick might come to you by messenger, or by an airplane drop off, or by some other means, even the Postal system if you live in town.\nAdvanced Tasks  File Management Using Nemo  File Management Tutorial ↕  if the Consultant needed to copy over language data files to move the data to a new computer, then he/she would want to know the basic file structure of Wasta-Linux, and where to copy the data files from, in the hierarchical file system of Linux. For this you would need to know Nemo, but you will find it very much like the MS Windows Explorer utility in Windows. The new part is understanding just where the common data files might live on the system.\nYou should take time to become familiar with the following features of the File Manager which are illustrated and explained below:\n Starting the File Manager ↕  The File Manager is a computer program. You can launch the File Manager in order to explore and access your computer\u0026rsquo;s folders and files. It can be launched from either the launch bar on the panel or from the computer\u0026rsquo;s Main Menu. The panel\u0026rsquo;s launcher icon for this File Manager looks like this:\nWhen you hold your mouse pointer over the folder icon in the launch bar it says, \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;. Click once on this \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; launch bar item to run the File Manager program.\nThe Nemo File Manager looks similar to this when it starts up:\nThe File Manager window has a number of important parts. At left is the Sidebar which lists the main locations on, or attached to your computer. When one of those locations is highlighted, the Contents Window will display what is at that location. There are different \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; of the information in the Sidebar and also different \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; of the items in the Contents Window - we will explain more about those views and the other parts of the File Manager below.\n    The Home Folder ↕  The top-level folder on your computer is your Home folder. It is represented as an icon and the name \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; that looks like this image shown above. The Home folder is listed as the first item in the Sidebar on the left side of the File Manager. All of your computer\u0026rsquo;s other folders and files are contained in your Home folder. When you highlight the Home folder by clicking the mouse pointer on it, the contents of your Home folder are shown in the right hand Contents Window of the File Manager.\n    The Default Folders ↕  Within your Home folder there are several folders already provided for you as \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; folders. The default folders include the following: Desktop, Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos and Downloads. Each has a small icon or picture to the left of the name of the folder. These are listed under your Home folder within the File Manager like this:\nYou will notice that these default folders are also shown in the right side of the File Manager when you highlight your Home folder.\n    Folders that are automatically created by software programs ↕  In addition to the default folders, your Home folder will also contain some other folders created automatically by some of the programs you use. For example, the Adapt It program creates a folder called \u0026ldquo;Adapt It Unicode Work\u0026rdquo; which looks like this:\nThe orange folder icon represents the folder. The name of the folder is to the right of the folder icon and in this case is \u0026ldquo;Adapt It Unicode Work\u0026rdquo;. A little wedge appears to the left of the folder icon which can be clicked to list the folder\u0026rsquo;s contents (see \u0026ldquo;Listing a folder\u0026rsquo;s contents\u0026rdquo; below).\nThe Paratext program creates a folder called \u0026ldquo;ParatextProjects\u0026rdquo; which looks like this:\nIt is important that you not move or make changes to these folders that Adapt It and Paratext create. Adapt It and Paratext will manage all the files and child folders that are located in these two folders. If you accidentally move a folder that a software program automatically creates, the program will likely not work, or the program won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find the data you previously created while running the program.\n    Undo any accidental changes ↕  If you accidentally move or delete one of these folders, such as the ParatextProjects or AdaptIt folder, or a file or folder contained in one of these, you should immediately select Undo ... in the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s Edit menu (or use the Ctrl+Z shortcut) to Undo any accidental changes. If you have made any change to Adapt It\u0026rsquo;s or Paratext\u0026rsquo;s folders and cannot Undo those changes, you should \u0026ldquo;Restore\u0026rdquo; the folder you changed using the Wasta-Backup program\u0026rsquo;s Restore function.     Opening folders ↕  You can use the File Manager to navigate around in the file system. You can open folders by doing one of the following actions:\n Double-click on the folder\u0026rsquo;s name when it is visible in the contents window. Highlighting the folder name with a single click of the mouse pointer, and pressing the Enter key. This way of opening a folder is easier for some people who find it difficult to do a double-click.  When the folder opens, the File Manager shows the contents of the opened folder displayed in the right side of the File Manager. If the folder is empty, the window on the right will also be empty.\n    Listing a folder\u0026#39;s contents (without opening the folder) ↕  You can list the contents of a folder by clicking on the little right-pointing wedge that is shown next to the folder name:\nClick on the right-pointing wedge to list the contents of the folder, without opening the folder. After clicking, the right-pointing wedge points downward to show that it is listing the folder\u0026rsquo;s contents (see picture below):\nWhen the contents of a folder is listed, it may show other \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; folders. By clicking on the wedge next to each child folder you can see the contents of each new child folder, which may contain more folders or files. In the illustration at left the \u0026ldquo;Computer_Information\u0026rdquo; folder lists a folder called \u0026ldquo;Folders and Files Illustration\u0026rdquo; which lists a \u0026ldquo;Pictures\u0026rdquo; folder, which lists a \u0026ldquo;Bill Martin-Family\u0026rdquo; folder, which lists a \u0026ldquo;Bill\u0026rdquo; folder which just contains a picture file called \u0026ldquo;Bill.jpg\u0026rdquo;. If a folder is empty its list of contents will say \u0026ldquo;(Empty)\u0026rdquo;.\n    Child folders and parent folders ↕  A folder may contain one or more \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; folders (see illustration above). The folder that contains the child folders is called the \u0026ldquo;parent\u0026rdquo; folder. Child folders may also contain more child folders (grand-children), and so on. Any folder may also contain other kinds of files along with \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; folders.     The Navigation Path ↕  Note that the path that you have followed to get to the currently open folder is shown at the top of the File Manager. For example, after navigating to and opening the Computer_Information folder, the path to this folder will appear at the top of the File Manager in the toolbar as this example shows:\nThe right part of the above picture shows the navigation path you used to get to the opened Computer_Information folder, displaying the path from left to right. The path shows that you started navigating from the Home folder and into the Documents folder, and finally into the Computer_Information folder. Since the Computer_Information folder is the currently open folder (with its contents showing in the right side of the File Manager), it is highlighted in the path shown above.\n    Navigation Buttons and Symbols (for use in folder navigation) ↕  Look at the left end of the above illustration. You see some arrows and other symbols. You can see what they are for by holding the mouse pointer over them. A tooltip will appear with a short description of the tool. Here is what those arrows and symbols do if you click on them:\n   Button/Symbol Button/Symbol Function      Go to the previous visited location    Go to the next visited location (grayed out if there is no next location recently visited)    Go to parent folder    Reload the current location    Go to Home Directory    Go to Computer    Show more of the path to the left (when window is too small to show entire path)    Show more of the path to the right (when window is too small to show entire path)    As you navigate around to different child or parent folders the path displayed at the top of the File Manager will highlight the currently open folder, and that folder\u0026rsquo;s contents will appear in the right-hand part of the File Manager.\n    Directly displaying the contents of files ↕  Such as documents, pictures or video files from within the File Manager\nWhen the File Manager lists or shows the name of a file such as a document, a picture, or a video, you can usually cause that file to be opened by a program that knows how to open or display it \u0026ndash; right from within the File Manager. Basically, you can open these types of files the same way that you can open a folder from within the File Manager by doing one the following:\n Double-click on the file\u0026rsquo;s name. For example, the \u0026ldquo;Jason and Anne.JPG\u0026rdquo; file illustrated in the picture below can be double-clicked to open that picture file. Highlighting the picture file name with a single click of the mouse pointer, and pressing the Enter key. This calls up a program that opens the picture file and displays it to you. This way of opening a file is easier for some people who find it difficult to double-click.  The types of files that can be opened or displayed this way include .jpg, .png, .txt, .odt, .doc, .htm, .html and some other types. If the file does not open or does not display well using the above techniques, you may need to open the file within the program that created it.\nNote: You should not try to open .xml adaptation documents that are stored within an Adapt It project\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Adaptations\u0026rdquo; folder using the above techniques. The files may be displayed, but they won\u0026rsquo;t make much sense. They should be opened instead from within the Adapt It program.\n    Showing the contents of a USB Flash Drive ↕  The Nemo File Manager also shows any external devices that are plugged into your computer. The File Manager may automatically open when an external disk is plugged into your computer. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically open you can open it using the \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; launcher in the launch bar. When you plug in your flash drive for making backups, it will appear in the File Manager like this:\nIn the picture above the device that is plugged in is named \u0026ldquo;USB_BACKUP\u0026rdquo;. You can click on the device name to cause File Manager to show the contents of the device in the right hand File Manager window. The little icon to the right of a plugged in device:\nas shown above is the \u0026ldquo;Safely Remove\u0026rdquo; button. Before unplugging any USB device that stores information, you should always click on this \u0026ldquo;Safely Remove button. If the computer is busy writing information to the device, it will tell you to wait until it is finished. If you have opened a file on the USB drive, you should close it before clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Safely Remove\u0026rdquo; icon.\nWhen the device disappears, after clicking on it you know it is safe to remove the USB device.\n    Copying folders or files - the safe way ↕  There are times when you may want to copy folders or files to a different location, either on your own computer, or to an external USB flash drive.\nTo copy a folder or file do the following actions:\n Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and navigate to the folder or file that you want to copy. Click once on the name of the folder or file to highlight it. Click on the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; menu, and select the \u0026ldquo;Copy\u0026rdquo; menu item (or use the Ctrl+C shortcut). This makes a copy of the folder or file in the computer\u0026rsquo;s memory (clipboard). Plug in the USB device if the copy is to be made to that device. Navigate to the destination folder or device that is to receive the copy. It it is a folder double click on it to open the folder. If it is a device, select the device in the Devices group of the File Manager, and navigate to an appropriate folder on that device, and double click it to open it (you can create a new folder on that device if needed - see below). Click on the Edit menu to open it, and select the \u0026ldquo;Paste\u0026rdquo; menu item (or use Ctrl+V shortcut). The folder or file will be copied into the destination folder. Since you have done a copy operation the folder or file will now exist in both its original location and in the destination location. There are other ways to copy folders or files, but those are more dangerous, so I will not describe them in this document.      Creating, renaming, deleting or moving folders (and files) ↕   Creating a new folder ↕  You can create new folders to keep your documents, pictures, videos, and other data organized. Folders can be created inside of other folders. To create a folder, do the following actions:\n Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and decide where to create the new folder. You will create a new folder inside of some existing \u0026ldquo;parent\u0026rdquo; folder. Often you will create a new folder inside one of the default parent folders: Documents, Pictures, or Videos. Open the parent folder that will hold the new folder you are creating (see the \u0026ldquo;Opening Folders\u0026rdquo; section above). Click on the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;File\u0026rdquo; menu, and select the \u0026ldquo;Create New Folder\u0026rdquo; menu item. A new folder edit box opens that has the name \u0026ldquo;Untitled Folder\u0026rdquo; highlighted in the edit box. Type the name you want the new folder to have overwriting the \u0026ldquo;Untitled Folder\u0026rdquo; name, and press Enter when done. If the name turns out to be wrong you can rename it (see below).      Renaming a folder (or file) ↕  To rename an existing folder or file, do the following actions:\n Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and navigate to the folder or file whose name you want to change. Click once on the name of the folder or file to highlight it. Click on the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; menu, and select the \u0026ldquo;Rename\u0026rdquo; menu item. An edit box opens over the existing folder or file with the existing name highlighted in the edit box. Type the name you want the new folder or file to have overwriting the existing name, and press Enter when done. If the name turns out to be wrong you can try renaming it again.      Deleting a folder (or file) ↕  To delete a folder or file, do the following actions:\n Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and navigate to the folder or file that you want to delete. Highlight the folder or file you want to delete. Pause and make sure that you really want to delete the folder or file. When you are sure you want to delete it, tap the Delete key - once only! When you use the Delete key to delete a folder or file inside the File Manager, the deleted item is normally moved to the Trash folder. See the next section for how to retrieve a deleted folder or file from the Trash.  Note: Be very careful with the Delete key as it is easy to accidentally delete a folder or a file that should be kept. If you cannot find a file in the location you expected it to be, check for it in the Trash bin.\n   \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   \n How to retrieve a deleted folder (or file) from the Trash folder ↕   Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and navigate to the Trash folder. The Trash folder is one of the default folders in the \u0026ldquo;My Computer\u0026rdquo; group locations - in the left side of the File Manager window. Highlight the Trash folder to display the folders and files that are currently in the Trash bin. Select the folder or file that you want to \u0026ldquo;restore\u0026rdquo; so that it is highlighted. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Restore Selected Items\u0026rdquo; button at the top of the File Manager window. The selected item will disappear from the Trash bin and be restored to its original location in the file system.      Moving a folder (or file) - the safe way ↕  Much care needs to be taken when moving folders or files to different locations. You should only move folders and files that you have created - such as documents, pictures and videos. You should not attempt to move folders or files that are automatically created by software programs such as Adapt It and Paratext.\nTo move a folder or a file do the following actions:\n Open the File Manager (\u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo;) and navigate to the existing folder or file you want to move. Select the folder or file that you want to move so that it is highlighted. Open the Edit menu and select the \u0026ldquo;Cut\u0026rdquo; menu item (or use the Ctrl+X shortcut). The folder or item doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately disappear, but its icon will look grayed out to indicate the cut item has been copied to the computer\u0026rsquo;s memory (clipboard). Navigate to the folder location where you want the folder or file to be moved to and make sure that destination folder is open by double clicking on it, or highlighting it and pressing the Enter key. While the destination folder is open, click on the Edit menu and select the \u0026ldquo;Paste\u0026rdquo; menu item (or use the Ctrl+V shortcut). The folder or file will now appear in the new destination location and will no longer appear in its original folder location - effectively moving it from the old location to the new location. This is the safest way to move a folder or file. There are other more dangerous ways to move folders and files, but I won\u0026rsquo;t describe those ways in this document.      Different Views of File Manager\u0026#39;s Data ↕  The File Manager\u0026rsquo;s main window shows information about folders and files using different possible views of those folders and files. The different views can be changed if desired using some buttons or icons on the right end of the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s tool bar - near the top of its window. These buttons or icons can be used to change the view of your data as follows:\n   Button/Symbol Button/Symbol Function      Path / Location button This tool bar button acts like a toggle. Click it once to see the actual Linux file system location that is being pointed to in the File Manager. Click it again to go back to the normal state which shows a graphical picture of the path to the location being being pointed to in the File Manager. Hovering the mouse pointer over this button it says, \u0026ldquo;Use Location Entry\u0026rdquo;.    Search button This tool bar button acts like a toggle. Click it once to open a special Search bar under the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s tool bar. You can then type a word or phrase and click Enter to search your computer for a file that matches the name you enter. You can enter just part of the name if you can\u0026rsquo;t remember the whole name. When the search results appear you can refine your search by having it search for certain file types or in certain locations.    This sets the \u0026ldquo;Icon View\u0026rdquo; This tool bar button sets the view for the main window that displays files and folders in the File Manager, so that it shows only an icon and name representing the folder or file. In this view the folders and files are arranged in order in rows across the screen. This view doesn\u0026rsquo;t show any information about the folder\u0026rsquo;s contents or about a file\u0026rsquo;s size, type or date the file was modified.    This sets the \u0026ldquo;List View\u0026rdquo; This tool bar button sets the view for the main window that displays files and folders in the File Manager, so that it shows folders and files in a vertical list with information about each file in columns to the right of the folder/file name. See \u0026ldquo;List View\u0026rsquo;s Information Column Headings and Sort Orders\u0026rdquo; section below for more information about this useful view. I suggest you use this view most of the time you have the File Manager open.    This sets the \u0026ldquo;Compact View\u0026rdquo; It is like the \u0026ldquo;Icon View\u0026rdquo; above, but uses smaller icons, and arranges them in order within vertical columns. This view doesn\u0026rsquo;t show any information about the folder\u0026rsquo;s contents or about a file\u0026rsquo;s size, type or date the file was modified.    Note: The last three buttons (the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; buttons shown above), can also be selected from the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s View menu (near the bottom of the menu).\n    List View\u0026#39;s Information Column Headings and Sort Orders ↕  When the File Manager is set to \u0026ldquo;List View\u0026rdquo; (see above), the top of the main window displays this bar that is divided into 4 column headings: Name, Size, Type, and Date Modified. The header bar looks like this:\nThe \u0026ldquo;List View\u0026rdquo; is my recommended view since it gives the most information about the folders and files on your computer. See the above section called \u0026ldquo;Different Views of File Manager\u0026rsquo;s Data\u0026rdquo; for information about other possible \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; of your folders and files.\nThe headers you see in the image above only appear in the \u0026ldquo;List View\u0026rdquo;. This view displays some helpful information about the folders and files that are listed under the headings.\n    Sort orders in List View ↕  Each list view header can determine the sort order of the folders and files listed below the headers. The sort order can be determined if you click directly on the header. For example, if you click on the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; header segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted in reverse alphabetical order (bottom of the alphabet at the top). If you click the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; header segment of the bar a second time, the folders and files will be sorted in normal alphabetical order (top of the alphabet at the top).\nIf you click on the \u0026ldquo;Size\u0026rdquo; header segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted according to their size, from smallest to largest. A second click on the \u0026ldquo;Size\u0026rdquo; segment will sort the folders and files from largest to smallest. If you want to view the files sorted by Name again rather than Size you can click on the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; segment of the header bar.\nIf you click on the \u0026ldquo;Type\u0026rdquo; header segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted according to their type - sorting them alphabetically by their extension. A second click on the \u0026ldquo;Type\u0026rdquo; header segment will reverse the order - but still using the extension to sort by rather than the name. If you want to view the files sorted by Name rather than by Type you can click on the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; segment of the header bar.\nFinally, if you click on the \u0026ldquo;Date Modified\u0026rdquo; segment of the bar, the folders and files will be sorted according to the date they were last modified - from newest to oldest. A second click on the \u0026ldquo;Date Modified\u0026rdquo; header segment will reverse the order - from oldest to newest. Each additional click on \u0026ldquo;Date Modified\u0026rdquo; reverses the sort order by dates. If you want to view the files sorted by Name rather than by Date Modified you can click on the \u0026ldquo;Name\u0026rdquo; segment of the header bar.\n    The buttons and tools on the status bar ↕  The File Manager has a status bar at the bottom of its window. It looks like this:\nThe middle of the status bar tells how many items are in the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s main window, and how much free space in on our computer. The other items on the left and right sides of the status bar are described below:\n   Button/Symbol Button/Symbol Function      This is the status bar\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Show Places\u0026rdquo; switch. When this button is pressed, the File Manager shows the list of places in the left part of its window (called the \u0026ldquo;Sidebar\u0026rdquo;). This list of places is grouped by categories with the default child folders of the Home directory in the top category called \u0026ldquo;My Computer\u0026rdquo;, followed by the group of \u0026ldquo;Devices\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Network\u0026rdquo; locations at the bottom. This is the recommended setting. This switch is automatically released if the \u0026ldquo;Show Treeview\u0026rdquo; button is pressed (see below).    This is the status bar\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Show Treeview\u0026rdquo; switch. When this button is pressed, the File Manager shows the the computer\u0026rsquo;s folders as a list in the left part of its window (called the \u0026ldquo;Sidebar\u0026rdquo;), with little wedge icons that allow you to click on them to see the contents of each folder without opening those folders. This treeview puts the Home folder at the top of the tree. This switch is automatically released if the \u0026ldquo;Show Places\u0026rdquo; button is pressed (see above).   or  These two buttons control whether the left part of the File Manager window (called the Sidebar) is open (visible) or closed (hidden). The top button closes the Sidebar. The bottom button (which is visible only when the Sidebar is closed) opens the sidebar. The same actions have a shortcut which is the F9 key on the top row of keys of the keyboard. The F9key acts like a toggle, alternately closing and opening the Sidebar.    This is a slider bar that can be used to adjust the zoom level.You can move the zoom setting pointer to the left to \u0026ldquo;zoom out\u0026rdquo; (making everything smaller so more items can be shown). Move the zoom setting pointer to the right to \u0026ldquo;zoom in\u0026rdquo; (making everything bigger which shows fewer items items but makes items easier to see). These settings can also be made on the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s View menu which also shows the shortcuts for these commands. The \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; zoom setting can be set by using Ctrl+0 (Ctrl+zero).    There are many other settings and features that are available on the File Manager\u0026rsquo;s menus. The one\u0026rsquo;s described in this document are the main ones.\n    The actual name of the File Manager ↕  Many Linux software programs have special names that the people who created the program have given to those programs. The special name of the File Manager we have described in this document is \u0026ldquo;Nemo\u0026rdquo;. There are actually a number of different File Managers that are available for Linux computers. We are using the one called \u0026ldquo;Nemo\u0026rdquo; on our Linux Mint computers. You can usually find the special name of nearly all Linux programs by running the program (usually from a menu or launcher) and then clicking on the program\u0026rsquo;s Help menu, and selecting the \u0026ldquo;About \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; item on that menu. If we click on our File Manager\u0026rsquo;s Help menu and select \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; a window appears like below:\nThis \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; dialog tells us some information about the Nemo program. It gives us the current version of the program (1.8.3), a short description of what the program does, and a button that will display the open source license that ensures that Nemo remains a free program which can be freely distributed. When programmers fix bugs and add features they release new versions of a program \u0026ndash; each newer version has a higher version number.\nWhat is the version number of the Nemo program on your computer?\n        "},{"idx":12,"href":"/hugo/home/customizing/launchpad-setup/","title":"Launchpad Setup","content":" Launchpad Setup "},{"idx":13,"href":"/hugo/home/customizing/maintain-package/","title":"Maintain a Custom Package","content":" Wasta-Linux: Maintain a Custom Package This page is part of the Wasta-Linux customizing process.\nGit is used for version control of all the Wasta-Linux custom packages. There is a Wasta-Linux organization on GitHub that contains separate GitHub repositories for each Wasta-Linux custom package. Any changes that are pushed up to these repositories are automatically copied every 6 hours to Launchpad, which is Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s site for managing software. Once the code is in Launchpad, there is another automatic process that builds the actual software packages and places them in the Wasta-Linux Testing Launchpad PPA. Once the \u0026lsquo;Regional Customizer\u0026rsquo; (you!) confirms that the package from the Wasta-Linux Testing PPA is good, any Wasta-Linux Launchpad member can copy it to the main Wasta-Linux Launchpad PPA. This main PPA is already included in every Wasta-Linux system, so once the packages exist in the PPA, all Wasta-Linux users will be able to install them when they update their system.\nSo, as a maintainer of a Wasta-Linux custom package, all you will need to do is get your changes to GitHub, and after that you should find your updated package available for install in the next day when you update your system.\nHere then are the steps for maintaining a Wasta-Linux custom package. I will use the wasta-custom-eth package as an example.\n Setup (only needs to be done the first time)\n GitHub setup You will need to create a GitHub account and register your SSH key with GitHub. Follow the steps in this GitHub setup guide.\n Install dependencies You will need to install some dependencies on your machine in order to have the necessary tools for building packages.\n Terminal * command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential devscripts dh-make dpkg-dev git   Configure git Git is used for version control so will need to be configured so that any changes you make will correctly be linked to your id.\n Terminal * commands: (execute commands 1 at a time)\ngit config --global user.email \u0026quot;you@example.com\u0026quot; git config --global user.name \u0026quot;Your Name\u0026quot;   Adjust your profile You need to adjust your profile settings so that your name and email will automatically be inserted when building the Wasta-Linux custom packages for local testing\n Terminal * command:\necho 'export DEBFULLNAME=Your\\ Name' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile   NOTE: the \\ delimiter is needed to account for the space in the name (between Your and Name in this example)  Terminal * command:\necho 'export DEBEMAIL=you@example.com' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile   NOTE: the user name and email address should match those used in step \u0026ldquo;1.c\u0026rdquo; above.   You will have to logout / login for these settings to take effect.\n Create a PGP key A PGP key is required to create a \u0026ldquo;local test package\u0026rdquo; of your Wasta-Linux custom package (see section 3 below)\n Open the Menu \u0026gt; Accessories \u0026gt; Passwords and Keys application\n Choose File \u0026gt; New and then choose \u0026ldquo;PGP Key\u0026rdquo;\n Important: do NOT enter a \u0026ldquo;key comment\u0026rdquo;, only enter \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;email\u0026rdquo;, or else there will be problems with using it later. The user name and email address should match those used in step \u0026ldquo;1.c\u0026rdquo; above. Setting the key to never expire should be OK. After entering a password, the key will be generated.\n Please wait, eventually the new key will show up under the \u0026ldquo;GnuPG Keys\u0026rdquo; tab, but unfortunately the application does not give much feedback during this key generation process    Create working folder You need a folder on your machine to use for the source code of the Wasta-Linux custom packages. You may create it in the location of your choice, such as your Documents folder. A suggestion is to name the folder wasta-packages, so it would look like this: /home/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/Documents/wasta-packages/.\n Clone package  Using the Wasta-Linux GitHub organization page, search for the wasta-custom-xyz GitHub repository that you would like to modify and click the copy to clipboard icon in the SSH clone url: section on the righthand side of the bottom of the page.\n Right click on the wasta-packages folder created in step \u0026ldquo;1.f\u0026rdquo; above and choose \u0026ldquo;Open in Terminal\u0026rdquo;\n Terminal * command:\ngit clone \u0026lt;pasted contents from your clipboard\u0026gt;  Example:\ngit clone git@github.com:wasta-linux/wasta-custom-eth.git   The \u0026ldquo;wasta-custom-eth\u0026rdquo; folder containing the current source code will now exist in your \u0026ldquo;wasta-packages\u0026rdquo; folder.\n  Get current source Right click on the \u0026ldquo;wasta-packages/wasta-custom-eth\u0026rdquo; folder and choose \u0026ldquo;Open in Terminal\u0026rdquo;\n Terminal * command:\ngit pull   Make changes to code Make any changes to the code, then we are ready to update the debian packaging files that are used to build the new version of the package.\n Debian folder references Here is a basic reference to the files in the \u0026ldquo;debian\u0026rdquo; folder, which is necessary to build the package after it finally arrives at Launchpad:\n debian/control: Most important debian file. Defines dependencies and other package details. debian/install: Defines files installed on the system when the package is installed.\nTypically Wasta-Linux custom packages have an \u0026ldquo;install-files\u0026rdquo; folder where all the files installed by a package reside. Confirm in this \u0026ldquo;debian/install\u0026rdquo; file.\nSometimes there is also a package name folder such as \u0026ldquo;wasta-custom-eth\u0026rdquo; in this example, that is installed to \u0026ldquo;/usr/share/wasta-custom-eth\u0026rdquo;. Again, this \u0026ldquo;debian/install\u0026rdquo; file will define these things.\n debian/changelog: Do NOT manually update this file, but instead use dch (see below).\n debian/postinst: Script executed after install of package. This should just call /usr/share/wasta-custom-eth/wasta-custom-eth-postinst.sh (I want this script easily accessible to others for reference: talk to me more if you want more gory details).\n  Update changelog Use dch to create the new version and enter comments regarding what changes you will make\n Terminal * command:\ndch --newversion 0.1.5   Replace 0.1.5 with your new version\n if prompted, choose /bin/nano as the editor, as it is the easiest to use.\n When using nano, the \u0026ldquo;^\u0026rdquo; character is entered using the Ctrl key on your keyboard.  Replace UNRELEASED with your series name\n 16.04: xenial 18.04: bionic  Enter some reasonable comments to document your changes. Reference older changelog entries for examples.\n Enter ^O (again, Ctrl + O) to save your changes.\n Enter ^X (again, Ctrl + X) to exit nano.\n    Build local test version  Terminal * command:\ndebuild -b  Builds a \u0026ldquo;.deb\u0026rdquo; package file for local testing\n You must have a PGP key set up that will sign the packages. Creating the PGP key is above in step \u0026ldquo;1.e\u0026rdquo;\n The resulting .deb will be created \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; one directory in the wasta-packages folder created in step \u0026ldquo;1.f\u0026rdquo;\n \u0026ldquo;Lintian\u0026rdquo; checks are done looking for any standards violations. Clean up any errors found and re-run until it is clean.\n You can \u0026ldquo;Google\u0026rdquo; the full lintian phrase to see the warning description. The following \u0026ldquo;warnings\u0026rdquo; can be ignored:\n Terminal output:\ndpkg-gencontrol: warning: Depends field of package wasta-custom-eth: unknown substitution variable ${shlibs:Depends}   Use the created .deb to install manually on another local machine for testing to ensure all changes are applied correctly.\n The testing machine must have the same \u0026ldquo;architecture\u0026rdquo; (32 bit or 64 bit) as the machine you created the .deb on.    Commit changes and push Git will now be used to commit the changes and then push them to GitHub.\n Clean up Important: first clean up from the debuild -b process!\nThe debuild -b process from step 4 above creates some temporary build files that we don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep. Clean them up! This is important or else the next step to add files to git will add these temporary files, which we don\u0026rsquo;t want.\n Terminal * command:\ndebclean   Add new files If you have added any new files to the folder, you will need to \u0026lsquo;add\u0026rsquo; them to git so they are under version control.\n This is why it is important to run debclean first so that the temporary debian files won\u0026rsquo;t be added to version control! Terminal * command:\ngit add --all  All files in the wasta-custom-xyz folder not already part of git version control will be added to it\n  Confirm git status (can be done at any time)\n Terminal * command:\ngit status   Commit changes Until your changes are \u0026ldquo;committed\u0026rdquo; they are not updated in git.\n Terminal * command:\ngit commit -am \u0026quot;\u0026lt;short commit message\u0026gt;\u0026quot;   Example:\ngit commit -am \u0026quot;Adding LibreOffice Extension\u0026quot;    Push changes Pushing changes will transfer the git commits / updates to GitHub.\n Terminal * command:\ngit push    Launchpad package creation Launchpad will auto-build the package from GitHub as described below.\n Monitor Launchpad test build  Wasta-Linux Team Launchpad site\n Under \u0026ldquo;Related Projects\u0026rdquo; in the bottom right there should be a link to each Wasta-Linux custom package project  Launchpad will automatically import source code from Github every 6 hours.\n Launchpad will automatically build new packages every 24 hours in the Wasta-Linux Testing PPA.\n Please contact the Wasta-Linux team if you need either of these processes expedited   Test package Before distributing the new package to all Wasta-Linux users, it is advisable to test install the package first, only submitting to other users after it is confirmed to be error free.\n Add Wasta Testing PPA Ensure you have the Wasta-Linux Testing PPA added to your system\n Terminal * command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:wasta-linux/wasta-testing   Update your package lists  Terminal * command:\nsudo apt-get update   Install test package  Terminal * command:\nsudo apt-get install wasta-custom-xyz    Copy package to main PPA After confirming the package in the Wasta-Testing PPA is ready to be distributed to other users, it must be copied to the main Wasta-Linux PPA. Any Wasta-Linux Launchpad member can copy packages between PPAs.\n Follow this guide to become a Wasta-Linux Launchpad member.  The package is now available to all Wasta-Linux users.\n   * To open the Terminal, in Wasta-Linux go to Menu \u0026gt; Administration \u0026gt; Terminal, or press the following keys at the same time: Ctrl + Alt + T\n"},{"idx":14,"href":"/hugo/tutorials/usb-install/","title":"Portable USB Installation","content":" Wasta-Linux: Installing to an Encrypted USB Drive It may be desirable to install Wasta-Linux to an encrypted USB drive for security or portability. Following this guide you will need 2 USB drives, one with a standard Wasta-Linux \u0026ldquo;live installer\u0026rdquo; ISO and a second USB drive (preferably a 32+ GB high quality USB3 drive) that will be your target encrypted USB Wasta-Linux system.\n Machine Setup In order to ensure the USB drive will be UEFI/Secure Boot compatible, make sure the machine is in \u0026ldquo;Secure Boot / UEFI mode.\u0026rdquo;\n Remove internal HDD It is recommended to remove the internal HDD so that when building the USB system it will not be aware of the internal HDD OS. Then when booting from the USB system it will not stop at a \u0026ldquo;GRUB\u0026rdquo; prompt. Removing the internal HDD also ensures you will not risk installing incorrectly and damaging your internal HDD\u0026rsquo;s OS.\n Boot the Wasta-Linux \u0026ldquo;USB live installer\u0026rdquo; Do not have your \u0026ldquo;target USB drive\u0026rdquo; inserted into the machine at this point. Boot the \u0026ldquo;Live Installer\u0026rdquo; as normal.\n Insert \u0026ldquo;target USB drive\u0026rdquo;, Start Installer When coming to the \u0026ldquo;Installation type\u0026rdquo; screen, choose \u0026ldquo;Erase Disk and install Wasta-Linux.\u0026rdquo; Also ticked the box next to \u0026ldquo;Encrypt the new Wasta Linux installation for security\u0026rdquo; (which then by default selects the LVM tick box as well). See screenshot below:\n Setup Encryption Security Key Enter an encryption key and optionally chose to overwrite empty disk space for additional security. See screenshot below:\n Complete Installation Continue with the installation until finished. FYI the final partitioning on my test target USB is as follows in gparted:\n /dev/sda1: 512MB fat32 \u0026lt;boot, esp flags\u0026gt;\n mount point: /boot/efi\n /dev/sda2: 732MB ext4\n mount point: /boot\n /dev/sda3: 27.42GB [Encrypted] lvm2 pv\n mount point: live-vg (when unencrypted it is \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;)\n  See screenshot below:\n Test target USB system Shutdown and unplug the \u0026ldquo;Live System USB\u0026rdquo;. Then re-insert the original HDD, and, ensuring the \u0026ldquo;target USB system\u0026rdquo; is connected, start the computer. Press the required key to bring up the \u0026ldquo;Boot Manager\u0026rdquo;, and select the USB drive. The target USB system should boot, prompting for the disk encryption key before unencrypting the drive. This \u0026ldquo;target USB system\u0026rdquo; should be able to boot on machines using UEFI / Secure Boot and on machines using \u0026ldquo;Legacy Boot\u0026rdquo;. There may be a message that flashes by when booting indicating something about \u0026ldquo;Boot Order\u0026rdquo; but it can be ignored.\n Inserting target USB system when running a different OS Inserting the USB into another computer already running Linux will prompt for the encryption key before mounting the USB drive. A machine running Windows will not be able to prompt for the encryption key and will not be able to mount the USB drive. So overall this seems like a quite secure system that is not known to the host machine.

As with most screenshot utilities, you have the ability to screenshot your entire desktop, a specific application window, or a selected area of your desktop.\n Shutter Main Window Hilighted above are the basic options for taking screenshots using the Shutter Main Window:\n 1. Selection: take screenshot of selected area of your desktop\n2. Desktop: take screenshot of your entire desktop\n3. Window: take screenshot of selected window\n4. Include Cursor: Include or exclude cursor in screenshot\n5. Delay: select the delay time before taking a screenshot (helpful if you want to choose a specific menu item for the screenshot)\n6. Section of window / Tooltip: Shutter even has the ability to screenshot tooltips and menus, which many screenshot utilties aren\u0026rsquo;t able to do as easily\n7. Edit: Shutter includes an integrated graphic editor (see below)\n  Shutter Edit Window Additionally, Shutter provides the ability to do light editing of screenshot images. Hilighted above are the main features of the Shutter Edit Window:\n 1. Arrow: Insert an arrow\n2. Box: Insert a box\n3. Text: Insert text\n4. Auto-Increment: insert sequential numbers (as in the screenshot)\n5. Crop: Crop the image\n You can control the color of the outline as well as the fill color of objects. Note that by default there is a 0,0,255 with a 59 transparency for boxes. This gives a light blue transparent box that will help to hilight the area. For writing text on top of dark images, it is first recommended to place a box on the image with a solid white background (255,255,255, transparency 255) before placing the text.\n Shutter Plugins One additional great feature of Shutter is the integrated plugins. You can experiment with these, but I will hilight one of plugin that is recommended for Wasta-Linux screenshots, the \u0026ldquo;Hard Shadow\u0026rdquo; plugin.\nFirst, right-click on your image and choose \u0026ldquo;Run a Plugin\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;:\nThen, choose \u0026ldquo;Hard Shadow\u0026rdquo; from the plugin list and click \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo;:\nKeep the default settings in the Hard Shadow Window and click OK:\nThe shadow is now applied and you are taken back to the Shutter Main Window:\nYou will now be able to notice the \u0026ldquo;checkered box\u0026rdquo; around the outside of the image which indicates the shadow has been applied to a transparent background.

To not annoy other existing users on the system, Wasta-Layout will not change their existing desktop layouts.\nBelow are descriptions and screenshots of the various Wasta-Layout desktop layouts:\nDefault The \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; layout option of Wasta-Layout largely matches the defaults directly from the Cinnamon development team.\nNotable items include: - The bottom panel and Main Menu are similar to Windows XP - Application windows are not grouped\nRedmond7 The \u0026lsquo;redmond7\u0026rsquo; layout is meant to match Windows 7\u0026rsquo;s interface more closely than the Cinnamon default layout.\nNotable differences compared to the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; layout include: - Application windows are grouped together, with a number in the top left of showing the number of running windows for each application. - The bottom panel is slightly taller in order to give larger panel icons\nCupertino The \u0026lsquo;cupertino\u0026rsquo; layout is meant to loosely match Apple\u0026rsquo;s macOS / OSX interface.\nNotable differences compared to the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; layout include: - The panel is placed at the top - A \u0026lsquo;dock\u0026rsquo; is placed at the bottom: it will hide automatically when windows are placed over it. Dock items can \u0026lsquo;zoom\u0026rsquo; when hovering over them - The panel is semi-transparent (but becomes non-transparent when a window is placed next to it)\nNotable shortcomings compared to Apple\u0026rsquo;s macOS / OSX interface: - There is no \u0026lsquo;Global AppMenu\u0026rsquo; (application menus will show in the application\u0026rsquo;s own window rather than in the main system panel)\nUnity The \u0026lsquo;unity\u0026rsquo; layout is inspired by Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s Unity interface, which was Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s default from 2011 through 2017.\nNotable differences compared to the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; layout include: - The panel is placed at the top - A non-hiding \u0026lsquo;dock\u0026rsquo; is placed on the left side. - The Main Menu is the top item in the dock, and has the shutdown menu and favorites removed. - The shutdown menu is in the top right. - The panel and dock are semi-transparent (but become non-transparent when a window is placed next to them)\nNotable shortcomings compared to Ubuntu Unity\u0026rsquo;s interface: - There is no \u0026lsquo;Global AppMenu\u0026rsquo; (application menus will show in the application window rather than in the main system panel) - There is no \u0026lsquo;HUD\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;heads up display\u0026rdquo;): this is the ability in Unity to quickly find application menu items by pressing ALT then typing to search for the desired setting. The global menu is required for this functionality, and at this time there is no easy way to add a global menu to Cinnamon. - The end result is that the panel in the Wasta-Layout Unity interface is largely unused (except for the right side). So unfortunately this means that vertical space is not as efficiently used as under Unity.\nWidescreen The \u0026lsquo;widescreen\u0026rsquo; layout seeks to maximize vertical space for today\u0026rsquo;s widescreen displays.\nNotable differences compared to the \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; layout include: - The panel is placed on the left side, with no bottom panel - Application windows are grouped together, with a number in the top left of showing the number of running windows for each application - Some of the \u0026lsquo;system tray icons\u0026rsquo; in the bottom left of the panel can be be collapsed to reduce the space they take up in the panel - The panel is semi-transparent (but becomes non-transparent when a window is placed next to it)\nWidescreen layout with the system tray collapsed:\n Widescreen layout with the system tray expanded:\n  "},{"idx":24,"href":"/hugo/","title":"Wasta-Linux - Home","content":" Wasta-Linux: Welcome to Computing Freedom!

"},{"idx":26,"href":"/hugo/wasta-apps/wasta-offline/","title":"Wasta-Offline","content":" Wasta-Offline: Offline Software Updates and Installs What is it? Wasta-Offline is a simple utility for updating or installing software packages on a Linux machine from a local \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, resulting in saving many hundreds of MB or even a few GB of internet downloads. Typically this is useful in areas with poor, expensive, or non-existent internet, but it is indeed quite handy for everyone without a central update caching server that has to support multiple Linux machines. It was written because aptoncd, apt-cache, and other offline tools didn\u0026rsquo;t fit our need and mostly seem to be abandoned.\nHow do I use it? Step One: Set up from a \u0026lsquo;Source Machine\u0026rsquo; The first step in using Wasta-Offline is to populate the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder from a \u0026lsquo;source machine\u0026rsquo; for use on other \u0026lsquo;destination machines\u0026rsquo;. This can be done using 2 different methods (they can both be used in tandem if desired):\n Wasta-Offline-Setup: The Wasta-Offline-Setup utility can be used to copy the existing local cached packages from the \u0026lsquo;source machine\u0026rsquo; to a \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, typically located on a USB drive. Here is a screenshot of Wasta-Offline-Setup:  Specifically, Wasta-Offline-Setup will copy the packages to a wasta-offline/local-cache folder. Wasta-Offline-Setup will keep separate caches for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, so if you want to use Wasta-Offline for destination machines of both architectures you will need to run Wasta-Offline-Setup from multiple source machines (one 32-bit source machine and one 64-bit source machine).\n Subsequent runs of Wasta-Offline-Setup will add to the wasta-offline/local-cache repository, so you can continue to build the local cache repository as you come into contact with machines that have packages already installed that you want to make available to other destination machines via Wasta-Offline. As a note, eventually, your wasta-offline/local-cache folder may need manual \u0026lsquo;cleaning out\u0026rsquo; if you start to run out of space on the device holding the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, as duplicate outdated versions of packages get copied to it (multiple versions of Firefox, LibreOffice, etc., for example).\n  apt-mirror: If your destination machines have no internet, and/or the location of the source machine you will use to populate the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder has good internet, you may want to use apt-mirror to populate the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder for use on destination machines.\n Using apt-mirror, you will create FULL copies of the specified internet repositories, so all packages in these repositories will be available to destination machines via Wasta-Offline, as of the date of the most recent apt-mirror run, regardless of whether or not they have been installed on the source machine. An apt-mirror \u0026lsquo;base path\u0026rsquo; of wasta-offline/apt-mirror should be used in order for destination machines running Wasta-Offline to be able to use these apt-mirror repositories.\n Apt-mirror has no gui, so you will need to set up a simple configuration file for it and run it from the terminal. As a note, setting up apt-mirror repositories like this will require many GB of downloads from the internet on the initial apt-mirror run. Later runs can be done to update the apt-mirror repositories, only downloading changes in the available packages in the repositories since the previous apt-mirror run.\n   How do I use it? Step Two: Use on a \u0026lsquo;Destination Machine\u0026rsquo; See this screenshot of running Wasta-Offline on a destination machine:\nThe first thing to note is that Wasta-Offline has the option to run in 2 different \u0026ldquo;modes\u0026rdquo;, explained in detail here:\n Offline Only (Default Mode): In this mode, a computer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;apt sources\u0026rdquo; (listing of available software repositories) is replaced with the repositories found in the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder (again this can be both the wasta-offline/local-cache repository generated from Wasta-Offline-Setup and any number of wasta-offline/apt-mirror repositories generated by apt-mirror). This means that the only available packages for installs or updates while running Wasta-Offline will be from the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder. If a desired package or dependency is not found in the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, it will not be able to be installed.\n Offline And Internet (\u0026lsquo;Hybrid\u0026rsquo; Mode): In this mode, the repositories found in the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder are inserted at the beginning of the computer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;apt sources\u0026rsquo; (listing of available software repositories). This means that software packages from the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder will be preferred over identical internet versions, but if software packages are installed or updated that do not exist in the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, they will be downloaded from the internet (after finishing using Wasta-Offline the user may then want to run Wasta-Offline-Setup on this machine in order to add the downloaded packages to the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder for subsequent use on other destination machines).\n  Once selecting the mode that Wasta-Offline will run in, the necessary system adjustments are made and the following window is displayed:\nThis window needs to stay open while other software utilities are used (such as Synaptic Package Manager) to perform the actual software package updates or installs. Note that due to some unfortunate shortcomings, Software Center is not able to be used in the default \u0026lsquo;Offline Only Mode\u0026rsquo;, as it requires an internet connection to install software.\nFor terminal users, once Wasta-Offline is \u0026ldquo;Ready\u0026rdquo; you can use this command to update your system:\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade  Once all software package updates and installs have been performed, clicking the \u0026lsquo;Finished\u0026rsquo; button will close Wasta-Offline and all \u0026lsquo;apt sources\u0026rsquo; (listing of available software repositories) will be returned to their prior states.\nCongratulations, you just saved lots of time and possibly lots of money getting your Linux system updated!\nHow do I install it? For Wasta-Linux users, Wasta-Offline will automatically be installed when you update your system. However, for \u0026lsquo;source machines\u0026rsquo; that will set up the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder with cached software packages, you will need to install \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline-setup\u0026rsquo; using Synaptic Package Manager or Ubuntu Software Center.\nFor other Ubuntu-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc), the easiest way to install Wasta-Offline and Wasta-Offline-Setup (for source machines) is to use a Terminal *. Copy each of these three commands and enter them in the Terminal (one at a time; you will need to provide an administrative password):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:wasta-linux/wasta-apps sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install wasta-offline wasta-offline-setup  If you want to install Wasta-Offline on destination computers without internet access, it should be possible to manually install the wasta-offline_\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.deb from the wasta-offline/local-cache/... folder. The \u0026lsquo;dependencies\u0026rsquo; are kept to a minimum for Wasta-Offline to allow this use case.\nAs a practical usage example, the individual setting up the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder on the source machine could copy these wasta-offline_\u0026lt;version-number\u0026gt;.deb installers to the root of the USB device used to deliver the \u0026lsquo;wasta-offline\u0026rsquo; folder, so that destination machine users will find it easily in order to install, after which these users can launch Wasta-Offline to perform the rest of the software package updates or installs.\n* To open the Terminal, in Wasta-Linux go to Menu \u0026gt; Administration \u0026gt; Terminal, or press the following keys at the same time: Ctrl + Alt + T\n"},{"idx":27,"href":"/hugo/home/customizing/wasta-remastersys/","title":"Wasta-Remastersys","content":" Wasta-Remastersys This page is part of the Wasta-Linux customizing process.\nThe Wasta-Linux ISOs are created using Wasta-Remastersys.

As of March 2014, all machines in this NE Africa location were migrated to Linux. As of 2019, several other of our Organization\u0026rsquo;s locations in Africa, North America, and Asia, have begun to embrace Linux, accounting for several hundred additional installations worldwide.\nI would like to explain our motivation for making this choice, the outcome of this move as we have seen so far, and why we feel that Linux is the best operating system choice for our work for both national colleagues and partners with low education and technical skills and for more experienced national colleagues and expats working alongside them. I also want to be clear up front in suggesting that our Organization should seriously consider increasing efforts to enable users in developing countries to use Linux in their translation and literacy efforts.\nLargely our consideration of Linux as the preferred option has come through several years of observation of computer use by national partners and colleagues that have low levels of formal education and are \u0026ldquo;new to computers\u0026rdquo;. Yet these users are involved with language, literacy, and translation work, often working independently without adequate training or supervision. Often I see these individuals struggle with several aspects of Microsoft Windows that prevent them from growing in their productive use of computers as a major tool in their work.\nIn my observations, I have found that Linux has addressed many of these problems in freeing them to focus on the work at hand rather than being confused and challenged by repeated issues with Microsoft Windows. While we are able to largely address many of these \u0026ldquo;repeated problems with Microsoft Windows\u0026rdquo; with our Organization-owned computers and directly managed and employed staff computers, these continual problems are real in the day-to-day world of those that we are coming alongside in the broader efforts of translation and literacy such as partner organizations and other individuals using their own personal computers for the work. I hope that through the following discussion some of these inherent problems with Windows and the suggestive solutions that Linux addresses will be made more clear.\nLinux is Free, but is it \u0026ldquo;viable for our work\u0026rdquo;? Obviously the main argument people may use when promoting Linux is that it is \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost money). Of course this is quite relevant when considering our target users in a developing-world context that struggle to make it day-to-day to meet the food and shelter needs of their families. But I think we all understand this issue, and want to save money where possible. Some skeptics may suggest that \u0026ldquo;it is free but it isn\u0026rsquo;t viable for our work\u0026rdquo;. I suggest otherwise, and hope to outline some of the reasons as I go along in this discussion.\n So, indeed the cost savings of moving to Linux would be quite significant for our Organization but also especially for nationals partnering alongside us in the efforts, especially when the recurring costs of anti-virus software and the costs of Microsoft Office are added.\nYet I am not going to talk much about Linux not costing money since the main point is that it needs to be seen as viable for use first before the cost savings can even be considered. For this reason, rather than discussing cost savings, I want to focus on the other benefits of Linux being free, in a much broader sense of the word that implies \u0026ldquo;freedom for the users\u0026rdquo;. Much of the rest of my discussion will center around the ways that this freedom makes Linux the best choice for many of our computer usage situations in our Organization, particularly in the developing world context.\n  Free means Free from Viruses  \u0026hellip;currently, but also read on about Linux\u0026rsquo;s better chances at staying this way in the future\n The main benefit that my African IT colleague sees with Linux is that it is largely considered virus-free. One of the biggest struggles for this colleague is helping Windows users fix up major \u0026ldquo;virus messes\u0026rdquo;. He spends a lot of time trying to keep their anti-virus software up to date and running. Yes, products such as NOD32 or Symantec Endpoint are more effective than many of the \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; anti-virus options (not \u0026ldquo;free as in freedom\u0026rdquo; as I will refer to here but only free as in \u0026ldquo;no payment required\u0026rdquo; and subjecting the user to included advertising, continual reminders to upgrade to the paid \u0026ldquo;pro\u0026rdquo; version, and additional bloatware installed \u0026ldquo;for free\u0026rdquo;). But the challenges of keeping everything up-to-date and organized with poor internet connections, license management, etc., in a world that has many diverse demands placed on him means that in practice this IT colleague often is not successful in keeping things working smoothly for Windows users. It takes a lot of organization to take advantage of the cost savings and \u0026ldquo;keep on top of things\u0026rdquo;, and often he is distracted with other pressing issues.\nAfter a machine is compromised, of course the first thing viruses do are disable the anti-virus tools and their updates, etc., so it gets to be a complicated bit of cleanup. This colleague\u0026rsquo;s strengths are many, but they are not in areas of organization and being detail-oriented. It is very important to note that I would suggest many of our national colleagues or partners that didn\u0026rsquo;t grow up in a highly-academic society probably aren\u0026rsquo;t as detail-oriented as consistent and organized computer use and management requires. The result is that often these cleanup tasks are not fully completed, meaning that in practice there are many vulnerable machines floating in and out of our offices. For example, the \u0026ldquo;market\u0026rdquo; is used for color print jobs, and it is guaranteed that after someone prints at the market they return to their personal computer and then viruses such as the \u0026ldquo;hide all your valid files\u0026rdquo; problems appear, even though these machines have paid licenses of professional anti-virus installed, yet may be negligently behind in their updates.\nOur \u0026ldquo;Organization owned machines\u0026rdquo; are largely immune to these daily hindrances due to auto-run being disabled and running corporate licenses of Symantec Endpoint with scheduled updates applied. But in this modern era of \u0026ldquo;enabling partner organizations\u0026rdquo;, it is very clear that we as trained Organization members and staff that have access to discounted software are not the only ones we need to strongly consider. Personal users and national partners in and out of our offices don\u0026rsquo;t have such access to discounted security tools, and we don\u0026rsquo;t have full control of their computers to provide it even if it is legally usable.    It is a continual headache and cycle of confusion, time, and concern. Many have stated that the number 1 reason they are wanting to go with Linux is because of the virus problems with Windows.\nThe most obvious reason Linux doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the virus and malware problems of Windows is because it has a much smaller market share. Indeed in the future, however, Linux can (and will) be targeted by virus and malware hackers. But I think that Linux will remain more resistant into the future for these key reasons:\n Linux was designed \u0026ldquo;from the ground up\u0026rdquo; as a networked operating system. Rather than needing to \u0026ldquo;patch in security features after the fact\u0026rdquo; like \u0026ldquo;Windows User Access Control\u0026rdquo; that showed up with Windows Vista and later, Linux has been designed from the beginning as a multi-user networked system with \u0026ldquo;smart authorization\u0026rdquo; required for system modifications.\n Since Linux is open source, it means the code is available for anyone to review. The common saying is \u0026ldquo;More eyes make fewer security flaws\u0026rdquo;. It may take a motivated individual to do this, but these same motivated individuals can also apply patches should they find a possible vulnerability. There doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a \u0026ldquo;waiting and hoping that the corporation will fix its security flaw\u0026rdquo;. Proprietary software, by being closed, is inherently unknown and un-reviewed by the outside world as to the potential loopholes that could be maliciously exploited.\n Since Linux is by far the predominant server platform in the world, especially on the Internet, security issues are a huge corporate concern, and therefore there is a lot of money flowing into Linux to ensure that known security flaws are quickly fixed.\n  Free means Freedom to Choose  \u0026hellip;which means Linux can be more Simple for Our Users\n One \u0026ldquo;negative\u0026rdquo; brought up by many about Linux is that there are \u0026ldquo;too many choices\u0026rdquo;, making it complicated for a new user to know which direction to go. Indeed, there are many different desktop environments, as they are called, to choose from with Linux. I argue, however, that this just means it is more difficult for experienced IT people such as myself to make a decision as to what is the preferred direction to promote to developing-world friends and colleagues. So, I do have additional work in continually evaluating the available options.\nBut with these many choices comes the freedom to use an environment that is well tailored for these targeted users. The version of Linux we are using and promoting is Wasta-Linux, which is a customized version of Ubuntu using Linux Mint\u0026rsquo;s acclaimed Cinnamon desktop environment. Cinnamon provides a familiar, traditional \u0026ldquo;Windows look and feel\u0026rdquo; for the user: in our testing with national users this familiarity is very important for those making the transition to Linux. Many in the Linux world want something \u0026ldquo;different than Windows\u0026rdquo;, but in our use-case I feel it is important to emphasize that day-to-day usage doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be much different from a familiar \u0026ldquo;Windows style workflow\u0026rdquo;. Since Linux can run our core applications like Paratext, FieldWorks, Adapt-It, Libre Office, Thunderbird, Firefox, Skype, etc., the familiarity of application use is also there for beginning users.\nContrast this familiarity of Cinnamon with Windows 8 interface forced on users some years back. Indeed this \u0026ldquo;Modern UI\u0026rdquo; may even have had several benefits for users after \u0026ldquo;getting used to it\u0026rdquo; or if one has a \u0026ldquo;touch screen\u0026rdquo; device, but for many people the were left frustrated and helpless to choose an alternative interface. For our Organization\u0026rsquo;s low-tech national users it was going to take significant training efforts to be able to use. The complication and confusion for national users I tested Windows 8 with means showed clearly that there would have been a huge learning curve for them in feeling comfortable with such a different paradigm.\n Thankfully, Microsoft finally caved in to several years of pressure and somewhat restored the traditional look in Windows 10. But the stark contrast between the traditional desktop apps and modern apps / Control Panel settings that jump the user back in \u0026ldquo;Modern UI mode\u0026rdquo; leave both advanced and beginning users alike very uncomfortable and confused.\nThe main point of this controversy surrounding the Windows 8 User Interface is that since Windows is NOT free there is no freedom to choose a different main layout to the system for users that may not meet the marketing segment that Microsoft is focusing on. I would suggest that, unfortunately, our developing-world colleagues and partners will never be able to gain this focus from Microsoft.\n  You have to ask how Microsoft can get away with ripping out their highly functional, traditional interface and enforce a completely new design without providing the user the freedom of choice. Even for IT, more and more freedom is lost as Microsoft removes options to control important things like the timing of massive Windows updates, or preventing auto-installed software/games. More and more, choices in Windows are being throttled, and that is the main point of this discussion since Linux restores the freedom to adjust defaults from Microsoft and others that favor bandwidth-rich areas, but hamper those in the developing world.\nBack to NE Africa and our switch to Wasta-Linux, the national users I have helped switch to Wasta-Linux have now been operating independently for well over a year (as Organizational ex-pats have had to strategically withdraw due to various issues). I just had a Skype call a few days ago with one of them who has only been using computers for 2 years.\nIn fact, 2 years ago I spent an entire morning with him helping him practice logging in and logging out (the most difficult part was the \u0026ldquo;capital A\u0026rdquo; in his password which was a learning lesson for me!). On the Skype call he indicated he doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any problems and that the few questions he has have been answered. He is working daily with Paratext, LibreOffice, and Thunderbird, and had only been using Linux for 2 months when I left NE Africa (and had never received more training than \u0026ldquo;here is how to start the computer, here is where your programs are, here is how to shutdown\u0026rdquo;). I am glad I don\u0026rsquo;t have to consider where he would be right now should I have migrated him to Windows and then had to leave. Likely he would be able to do his work with Windows, but I am very happy to have been able to leave him with a much more simple system to use, that he can confidently promote to others he interacts with.    In summary, I think the choices in Linux that give an option to use a traditional layout like Cinnamon give us control to be able to target what will be most effective for our users and what will allow them to gain confidence in their use of computers.\nFree means Freedom to Customize  \u0026hellip;which means Linux installation and support can be more simple for our national IT workers and others\n Another feature of Linux being \u0026ldquo;free as in freedom\u0026rdquo; means that people such as myself or our Organization\u0026rsquo;s Linux software development group in Calgary are able to \u0026ldquo;customize Linux installs\u0026rdquo; to be tailored for our specific use-cases. What I have done for our location in NE Africa is create a custom ISO of Wasta-Linux that is fully tailored and set up with all the software and settings needed for any national user in that location, including keyboards, fonts, language settings, software selections, etc.\nTo the benefit of the broader world of our Organization, Wasta-Linux can act as a \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; for any region or area that wants to further modify it by adding region-specific keyboards, standard training documents, etc., to have a ready-made installer customized for their situation. In fact, this is happening now in multiple countries around the world: resulting in ready-to-install usable systems tailored for low-tech lowly-educated users \u0026ndash; or high-tech highly-educated ones: the point is anyone can use it inside or outside our Organization!\nWasta-Linux then allows my African IT colleague to be much more efficient and successful in installing the system. To see this, first let me explain how he does things with Windows and then compare that to what he does now with the customized Linux installer that I am able to keep updated and provide him for his use.\nFor Windows, when he needs to re-install a system (often he goes this direction because the cleaning of viruses, etc., is much more difficult for him than a full wipe-and-install for severely crippled machines), my African IT colleague first installs the OS and the OS Updates. This requires a genuine Windows key, which is unlikely for individuals\u0026rsquo; personal computers to have, so we instead refer them to the \u0026ldquo;market\u0026rdquo;. After installing Windows, he then searches for various possible missing drivers (he mainly only deals with sound, video, and network drivers and ignores the other things that may not be working like the SD card reader, etc). Then he installs the Anti-Virus, and then the various software applications.\n   Each of these installs require managing and referencing organized license lists: in the case where it is a personal user it may require applications, payments, transfers, etc. Often the original keys for the user are missing or can\u0026rsquo;t be found, so then re-application or email is sent to get all this organized. Finally, after everything is installed, he then has to configure the system and software settings (which is often not done consistently, so then the user is confused by various things, so will later occasionally return to get extra things installed, re-configured, etc). Often this colleague will spend a minimum of 1-2 full working days to do this work for one crippled machine. Yes, there are tools that make this more efficient such as \u0026ldquo;wsus\u0026rdquo; to handle all the OS updates, etc., but again this takes organization and management which are not his strong points!\n Side Note: For our \u0026ldquo;Organization owned machines\u0026rdquo; we have \u0026ldquo;standard image backups\u0026rdquo; of machines that can be restored that have several of these steps accounted for. If we consider our Organization machines only, then, much of this effort is not needed. However, again, I feel the need to emphasize that this age of re-imagining our our Organization interacts in the world and with partners implies we are looking far beyond Organizational-owned and directly managed computers.\n  In contrast, when my colleague uses our customized Wasta-Linux installer, the most difficult part is getting the machine to boot from the USB flash drive installer. Once he finds the key combination to boot from USB, the total install will take approximately 20 minutes. The system is already configured with all the software and settings necessary. The complexity in doing it is reduced, and the resulting install is consistent and complete. Things such as Keyman keyboards, Thunderbird, Skype, office software (Libre Office), etc. are all there updated and ready for use.\nThe install process is so easy I have worked with other \u0026ldquo;non IT support\u0026rdquo; national friends to teach them to install Wasta-Linux. I would never consider this with the Windows process above. In fact, I had one \u0026ldquo;pirated Windows computer market\u0026rdquo; shop owner wanting me to show him how to install Linux before I left NE Africa. I regret not being able to show him at the time, since the simplicity of it would have likely quite surprised him. I would have loved to have seen the look on his face after he saw how easy it was to install Linux.\n  Free means Free FOR ALL to use Genuine Software  \u0026hellip;which means freedom from implicitly supporting software Piracy\n Much Windows software is free-of-cost, but what I have observed is that often these \u0026ldquo;free programs\u0026rdquo; come with \u0026ldquo;wrapper installers\u0026rdquo; that load additional toolbars in your web browser, install additional advertisement software, etc. that eventually bloat the system and confuse the user. Yes, an experienced user will opt-out of these additional bloat-ware installs, but a novice ESL user will likely miss these \u0026ldquo;opt-out\u0026rdquo; options: leaving a system full of crud and possible conflicting utilities performing similar tasks but each doing things in ignorance of each other, ultimately to the detriment of the user\u0026rsquo;s experience.\nIs this what \u0026ldquo;Free Software\u0026rdquo; means???\nLargely, however, the value in Linux being \u0026ldquo;genuine free software\u0026rdquo; means that the reasons behind and problems associated with pirated Microsoft software (Windows and Office) are made irrelevant. Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest: none of my NE Africa friends are going to pay the costs of genuine MS software if their machines weren\u0026rsquo;t purchased with it pre-installed. In NE Africa it is very common to purchase machines without genuine Microsoft software installed (instead pirated versions of Windows are used). In fact, it is quite difficult to even find a machine with genuine MS software to purchase, and if it is found, it is often identical to another machine but at a much higher price. As Microsoft has gotten more advanced in their attempted prevention of pirated versions of Windows, the pirates have also gotten more advanced. Currently, I have observed in NE Africa that it is quite common for the BIOS of a computer to be hacked to allow a pirated version of Windows to be installed. The result is that often the display drivers, network drivers, etc., are all confused and it is a very difficult situation to resolve. So, regardless of the ethics of the situation, there are practical headaches introduced by pirated software. I say \u0026ldquo;enough is enough\u0026rdquo; in this crazy cycle of Microsoft and the pirates continually attempting to \u0026ldquo;one-up\u0026rdquo; each other.\nRegardless of the practical problem of piracy, I strongly feel there are ethical concerns as well, even if many of the nationals I work with don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily see this issue the same way I do. Even where there is \u0026ldquo;no awareness of the illegality\u0026rdquo; of the situation, I want to urge us strongly that this is not an argument our Organization should use to justify the situation to ourselves. For me as a western background volunteer worker in an overseas assignment, I have been freed from this conflict through the use and promotion of Linux.\n Many expats may not think of these issues since they purchase machines with genuine MS Windows already installed. I want to be clear that I am not suggesting that all Organization ex-pat consultants and advisors that have years of experience and expertise in MS Windows be required to switch to Linux. I foresee those of us coming from \u0026ldquo;the privileged land of laptops coming with valid MS Windows\u0026rdquo; (and those of us who are able to properly maintain anti-virus definitions and avoid the pitfalls of \u0026ldquo;bloatware\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;malware\u0026rdquo;, etc.) be able to evaluate for ourselves what OS and Office program to use. But for our national colleagues in the developing world (and the increasing number of nationals outside our direct work: church partners, literacy program partners, etc.), often the choices are different. Often there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a reasonable, cost-effective, viable choice for them to use Windows and MS Office (legally: and, again, the problem is not only one of \u0026ldquo;legality\u0026rdquo;, but one of \u0026ldquo;quality\u0026rdquo;: the hacked pirated versions have driver problems, potentially embedded viruses, etc. that make it a real headache to deal with even apart from morals).   Again, Linux is not only free as in \u0026ldquo;no payment required\u0026rdquo;; it is also free as in \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo;. Yes, there are discount (or fully covered) programs that many in language work in Africa are approved to use for Windows, anti-virus, office, etc., software (thanks to many for their efforts in this area to help make these items more reasonable for African workers!). However, \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; is much more preferred: Freedom means the user can re-distribute it, customize it to their use case, etc.. It is free for anyone that comes through my office door, including staff, partner organizations, personal computers, friends-of-friends computers, etc: not just employees or those that fit the criteria for \u0026ldquo;no-cost or discounted licenses\u0026rdquo;.\nOur Organization\u0026rsquo;s Re-visioning for the Future  \u0026hellip;Not \u0026ldquo;Why Linux?\u0026rdquo;, but \u0026ldquo;Why NOT Linux?\u0026rdquo;\n Some have suggested it is important to question why Linux should even be considered, since it just \u0026ldquo;spreads us too thin with our limited resources\u0026rdquo;. But in light of the above reasons, I feel it is important instead to ask, \u0026ldquo;Why NOT Linux?\u0026rdquo; It is fully functional for many of our targeted users. It can be more simple for users, it can be more simple for IT support, it is free of cost, free of viruses, etc.: In large the consideration of Linux as a platform of choice for my national colleagues, partners, and friends counters a false underlying assumption: that we (Organizational members, national partners and colleagues, etc.) cannot be effective without Microsoft Office and Microsoft Windows.\nIn light of our Organization\u0026rsquo;s efforts, we need to consider the \u0026ldquo;whole effort toward translation and literacy\u0026rdquo; rather than focusing only on \u0026ldquo;Organization-owned computers and Organization-administered translation projects\u0026rdquo;. In NE Africa, we are trying to position ourselves to hopefully be able to move forward as a broad-based literacy and translation movement together with our national partners and the inclusive involvement of other nationals outside the Organization umbrella. Others in the Organization world I am sure are thinking along the same lines. I think it is important to understand that these efforts may be hindered by perpetuating the continual false assumption that MS products are the only way to be productive. With us supporting (and in many cases using) Linux, we ALL can have access to and use the same software to further the ends of translation and literacy work in the world. Linux being free means that the solutions we are providing can \u0026ldquo;self-propagate\u0026rdquo; to everyone in a decentralized and ongoing way.\nTo restate, what is happening in our part of NE Africa is certainly not an isolated case; other areas in our Organization are also moving this direction. As we consider our Organizations re-visioning for the future, we need to find ways of supporting nationals and national partners, so that they can participate more and more in Good Book translation. I see the opportunity to use Linux as a crucial step in this process for many people. In the past, we have automatically focused on what is best and easiest for ex-pats, as ex-pats have been the ones making the leadership decisions and organizing the efforts. But as we look toward migrating more to national administration and leadership, I feel a key piece in supporting this shift is using and sharing with them the tools and technology most appropriate for their context. In this case, I feel it critical that we consider it highly possible that Linux may be best positioned to provide this.    For the reasons laid out above I am suggesting that Linux being \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;secure\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;simple\u0026rdquo; (for novice users with basic computing needs) best meets the needs of our targeted users in developing countries. So, those of us that choose to use MS products (and other tools not available in Linux) can at a minimum do our best to facilitate compatibility and interoperability. Let our \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; be that which ALL of us can share together (Linux gives us this option).\n* If you are curious about who we are and want to know more about our Organization\u0026rsquo;s work, please leave a comment on one of the forums linked below and someone will get in touch with you.\n"}];window.bookSearch={pages:pages,idx:lunr(function(){this.ref("idx");this.field("title");this.field("content");pages.forEach(this.add,this);}),}})();
