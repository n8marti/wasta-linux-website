In brief, Linux is:\n Partner friendly Budget friendly Customizing friendly  Basically it is about freedom (not just \u0026ldquo;free as in no cost\u0026rdquo;), which means freedom to customize for our work and for our specific users (see more below on this topic), freedom for all to use it, and \u0026ldquo;free from viruses\u0026rdquo; (yes, eventually there may be Linux viruses). For more on these freedoms, please read the \u0026ldquo;case study\u0026rdquo; on our organization\u0026rsquo;s move from Windows to Linux in NE Africa.\n    Which Linux desktop and distribution is Wasta-Linux based on? ↕  With Ubuntu being recognized as the market leader in the Linux ecosystem, it was determined that using Ubuntu as a base for Wasta-Linux is the best choice. Using Ubuntu as a base ensures the broadest compatibility with Linux applications for Wasta-Linux.\nHowever, the default interface, called a \u0026lsquo;desktop environment\u0026rsquo; in Linux, used by Ubuntu proved challenging to use as it was not familiar enough for users coming from a Windows environment. After a lot of testing with several different Linux desktops, Cinnamon, created by the Linux Mint team, was chosen as the default interface for Wasta-Linux. For those that aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in adhering to a Windows-style interface, Cinnamon is flexible enough to be able to be reconfigured to match layouts inspired by macOS or Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s Unity.\n    What customizations are included in Wasta-Linux? ↕  For the curious, here is a summary of some of the most significant modifications made to Wasta-Linux when compared to stock Ubuntu plus the Cinnamon desktop interface:\n \u0026ldquo;SIL ready\u0026rdquo;: The SIL Linux repository is included and standard SIL fonts have been added, so that applications such as Paratext, Bloom, Fieldworks, Adapt It, WeSay and kmfl (Keyman) are ready for installation from the Software Center.\n Several applications added, several others removed. Notable additions include:\n Wasta-Backup: simple \u0026ldquo;version backup\u0026rdquo; utility Wasta-Offline: offline software updates and installs Wasta-Layout: desktop layout settings utility Wasta-Menus: limits the visible applications in the Main Menu Wasta-Resources: centralized distribution of reference and documentation materials Bloom: Literacy materials development for language communities Skype Kdenlive: Non-linear video editing software GoldenDict: Offline (and online using Wikipedia or other sources) Dictionary / Thesaurus Modem Manager GUI: USB 3G modem tool for balance check and top-up commands Pinta: simple to use \u0026ldquo;MS Paint\u0026rdquo; alternative Kiwix: offline simple English version of Wikipedia (due to it\u0026rsquo;s size - 1.6 GB - it is not installed by default in Wasta-Linux) Klavaro: typing tutor some useful command-line utilities such as: wavemon: a wifi network diagnostic tool traceroute iperf: a network throughput test tool  Centralized update and distribution of \u0026ldquo;future Wasta customizations\u0026rdquo;: No more being \u0026ldquo;stranded\u0026rdquo; as seems to happen with Ubuntu LTS releases.\n      So, what is \u0026#39;wasta\u0026#39; anyway? ↕  \u0026ldquo;Wasta\u0026rdquo; literally means \u0026ldquo;intermediary\u0026rdquo;, but it implies more: it is seen as having \u0026ldquo;insider connections\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;special favor or ability to \u0026lsquo;side-step the normal process.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Think of needing to wait several days in the heat of a government office to get an official \u0026ldquo;stamp\u0026rdquo; on a piece of paper. If you have wasta, then you are able to come around through the \u0026ldquo;side door\u0026rdquo; and get the stamp immediately. So, Wasta-Linux is essentially \u0026ldquo;cutting to the front of the line\u0026rdquo; for new users to Linux in order to get a usable system without all the effort of starting from nothing. The analogy doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when taken too literally, however: don\u0026rsquo;t think there is anything unethical or illegal in the process! Wasta-Linux is just a light-hearted way to explain that you get the Linux you have been hoping exists without needing to hack on it to get it set up as you want!     How many Wasta-Linux users are there? ↕  Great question! There are several locations using Wasta-Linux around the world, with some locations working in an offline-only environment. This means a single download could represent 10s of users or more. As of 2019, it seems clear that there are at least 500 Wasta-Linux users, but it could be multiples of that number.     How can Wasta-Linux be customized to meet my needs? ↕  Beyond individual users that may find the Wasta-Linux system available here **\u0026ldquo;as-is\u0026rdquo; to fit them well in their situations, it is intended that Wasta-Linux can be used as a base for \u0026ldquo;location specific customized\u0026rdquo; versions of Wasta-Linux (providing pre-installed location-specific fonts, keyboards, default applications, settings, reference documents and training materials, etc.). Once these \u0026ldquo;location specific customized Wasta-Linux versions\u0026rdquo; are made available, the ease of install of this customized Linux distribution will provide an opportunity for it to self-propagate throughout the region, even among low-tech computer users.\nIf customizing is of interest to you, please see this page: Wasta-Linux: Customizing for your needs\n   "},{"idx":14,"href":"/hugo/home/","title":"Homes","content":""},{"idx":15,"href":"/hugo/home/customizing/","title":"Re-customizing","content":" Wasta-Linux: Recustomizing "},{"idx":16,"href":"/hugo/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","content":""},{"idx":17,"href":"/hugo/wasta-apps/","title":"Wasta-apps","content":""},{"idx":18,"href":"/hugo/","title":"Wasta-Linux - Home","content":" Wasta-Linux: Functional, Familiar, and Free!
