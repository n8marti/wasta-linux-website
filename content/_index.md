# Wasta-Linux: Welcome to Computing Freedom!

Wasta-Linux is a computer operating system perfect for anyone wanting a **virus-resistant** system that is not only **free to share with anyone** but also provides **freedom** of flexibility and customization.

Regardless of what platform you're coming from, Wasta-Linux has an intuitive interface that is made to look familiar. The default desktop looks and feels a lot like **Microsoft Windows**, while [**Cinnamon-Layout**]({{< relref "/wasta-apps/cinnamon-layout.md" >}}) allows users to select interfaces inspired by **macOS** or **Ubuntu Unity**.

Wasta-Linux is ready *"out of the box"* for all your computing needs. Feel free to explore more about Wasta-Linux through the menu on the left or:

* Find more detail about Wasta-Linux on the [**Frequently Asked Questions**]({{< relref "/home/faq.md" >}}) page.
* Go directly to [**Download**]({{< relref "/home/download.md" >}}) if you are ready to get your copy of Wasta-Linux to install.
* Wanting to customize to make your own version of Wasta-Linux for your users? Check the [**Customizing**]({{< relref "/home/customizing.md" >}}) page.
* [**Why Linux**]({{< relref "/home/why-linux.md" >}}) is a good place to understand some of the background motivation for using Linux in a multi-national non-profit organization.
