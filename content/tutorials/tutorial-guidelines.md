# Guidelines for Creating Wasta-Linux Tutorials

## Screenshots

***Shutter*** is the application recommended for creating screenshots to use in Wasta-Linux Tutorials. As with most screenshot utilities, you have the ability to screenshot your entire desktop, a specific application window, or a selected area of your desktop.

* ### Shutter Main Window

    Hilighted above are the basic options for taking screenshots using the Shutter Main Window:

    > **1. Selection:** take screenshot of selected area of your desktop

    > **2. Desktop:** take screenshot of your entire desktop

    > **3. Window:** take screenshot of selected window

    > **4. Include Cursor:** Include or exclude cursor in screenshot

    > **5. Delay:** select the delay time before taking a screenshot (helpful if you want to choose a specific menu item for the screenshot)

    > **6. Section of window / Tooltip:** Shutter even has the ability to screenshot tooltips and menus, which many screenshot utilties aren't able to do as easily

    > **7. Edit:** Shutter includes an integrated graphic editor (see below)

* ### Shutter Edit Window

    Additionally, Shutter provides the ability to do light editing of screenshot images. Hilighted above are the main features of the Shutter Edit Window:

    > **1. Arrow:** Insert an arrow

    > **2. Box:** Insert a box

    > **3. Text:** Insert text

    > **4. Auto-Increment:** insert sequential numbers (as in the screenshot)

    > **5. Crop:** Crop the image

    You can control the color of the outline as well as the fill color of objects. Note that by default there is a 0,0,255 with a 59 transparency for boxes. This gives a light blue transparent box that will help to hilight the area. For writing text on top of dark images, it is first recommended to place a box on the image with a solid white background (255,255,255, transparency 255) before placing the text.

* ### Shutter Plugins

    One additional great feature of Shutter is the integrated *plugins*. You can experiment with these, but I will hilight one of plugin that is recommended for Wasta-Linux screenshots, the "Hard Shadow" plugin.

    First, right-click on your image and choose "Run a Plugin....":

    <p align="center"> ![Shutter Plugins](../../img/tutorials/tutorial-guidelines/shutter-plugin.png)

    Then, choose "Hard Shadow" from the plugin list and click "Run":

    <p align="center"> ![Shutter Hard Shadow](../../img/tutorials/tutorial-guidelines/shutter-shadow.png)

    Keep the default settings in the Hard Shadow Window and click OK:

    <p align="center"> ![Shutter Hard Shadow Save](../../img/tutorials/tutorial-guidelines/shutter-shadow-save.png)

    The shadow is now applied and you are taken back to the Shutter Main Window:

    <p align="center"> ![Shutter Hard Shadow End](../../img/tutorials/tutorial-guidelines/shutter-shadow-end.png)

    You will now be able to notice the "checkered box" around the outside of the image which indicates the shadow has been applied to a transparent background. When pasting this image into a document, the checkers will not appear, but the shadow will blend into the background of the document:
